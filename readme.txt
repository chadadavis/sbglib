This repository houses code common to Bioinformatics-related developement at EMBL. It represents an effort to promote code reuse.

For each of a number of common programming languages, utilities found to be of general interest to EMBL bioinformaticians are contained within a package/module named 'EMBL'

The rationale.txt contains a short description of the motivation and intended work-cycle to be used with these libraries.

The usage.txt contains a short description of how to get started using everything.
