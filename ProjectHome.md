These libraries focus on methods for structural alignment, manipulating 3D transformations, searching for structural templates for protein sequences, identifying symmetries, and identifying contacts at protein interfaces. It also provides an approach for homology modelling of multimeric complexes.


It is based on [BioPerl](http://www.bioperl.org), [Moose](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&query=Moose), the [Perl Data Language](http://pdl.perl.org/), and the open-source structural alignment suite [STAMP](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/Software/Stamp/stamp.html).
